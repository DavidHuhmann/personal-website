## E2E Testing with Playwright üé≠

This project supports easy integration with Playwright for end-to-end testing:

```bash
ng add playwright-ng-schematics
```

This adds Playwright configuration and example tests to your project. To run the tests:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22.x or higher)
- npm (latest version)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for containerized builds)

### Installation

**Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidHuhmann/personal-website.git
cd personal-website
```

**Install dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) and will automatically reload when you change any source files.

### Building the Project

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production build in the `dist` directory.

### Running Tests

To execute unit tests via Karma:

```bash
npm test
```

### Linting the Code

To lint your code:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Docker Support üê≥

You can build and run the Angular app in a Docker container.

**Build and run:**

```bash
docker build -t personal-website .
docker run -p 8080:80 personal-website
```

Make sure to provide an `nginx.conf` if you need custom routing support.

## Project Structure üìÅ

- **public/i18n/**: Translation files (`en.json`, `de.json`)
- **src/app/**: Application source code
  - **core/**: Core functionality
  - **features/**: Feature modules for modular development
  - **shared/**: Shared styling and utilities

---

## Internationalization üåê

This project uses [ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core) for i18n. Translation files are located in:

- `public/i18n/en.json` - English
- `public/i18n/de.json` - German

Default language and supported languages are configured in [`src/environments/environment.ts`](src/environments/environment.ts).

Usage in templates:

```html
{{ 'app.core.header.links.home' | translate }}
```

```typescript
imports: [TranslatePipe];
```

The language switcher component allows users to change languages dynamically.

---

## Styling üé®

- **TailwindCSS**: Utility classes in [`src/styles.css`](src/styles.css)
- **PrimeNG**: Theming and UI components, with a custom color preset in [`src/app/shared/styling/color.preset.ts`](src/app/shared/styling/color.preset.ts)
- **Custom Styles**: Component-specific styles using CSS files

---

## Git Hooks with Husky üê∂

This project enforces code quality using Husky:

- **Commit Message Format**: Enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format
  ```
  <type>(<scope>): <description>
  ```
  Valid types: feat, fix, chore, docs, test, style, refactor, perf, build, ci, revert

---

## Scripts üìú

- **`start`**: Starts the development server
  `npm start`
- **`build`**: Builds the project for production
  `npm run build`
- **`watch`**: Rebuilds the project on file changes
  `npm run watch`
- **`test`**: Runs unit tests
  `npm test`
- **`lint`**: Lints the project files using ESLint
  `npm run lint`
- **`prepare`**: Prepares Husky hooks
  `npm run prepare`

---

## Workflows ‚öôÔ∏è

- **CI**: [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)
  Runs tests and linting on every push and pull request to ensure code quality.
- **Create Release**: [`.github/workflows/create-release.yml`](.github/workflows/create-release.yml)
  Uses [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) for automated versioning and changelog generation on pushes to `production`.

## HTTP Interceptors üåê

The template includes an HTTP interceptor that:

- Shows a loading spinner during HTTP requests
- Handles error responses
- Provides a centralized way to modify HTTP requests and responses
